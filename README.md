# stream-roll

### The problem StreamRoll solves
Transferring tokens has been one of the most basic and crucial mechanisms of crypto ever since its inception. However, the problem of token streaming and its specificity to only a few chains still remains as a partially solved problem.

What streamroll does is that we abstract away the complicated and computationally heavy bit in a suffieciently decentralised micro-rollup built on stackr in a way that the user has an even smoother experience than on any chain. We have built the protocol as so that the user only needs to bridge their tokens from any EVM onto our network, perform any actions related to streaming as they usually would, and most importantly, withdraw these tokens on any EVM network of their choice.
